# 8. Next Steps

## 8.1 UX Expert Prompt
**Not Applicable** - This is a backend service with no UI components.

## 8.2 Architect Prompt
"Review the Ollama-to-OpenAI Proxy Service PRD and create a detailed architecture document. Focus on the translation layer design, streaming implementation, and error handling strategies. Ensure the architecture follows KISS/YAGNI principles and supports the incremental development approach outlined in the epics. Pay special attention to the Ollama API contract analysis requirements (Story 1.2) as this is the foundation for all subsequent work."

## 8.3 Scrum Master Guidance
- Each story should be broken into subtasks during sprint planning
- Enforce "Definition of Done" - no story complete without passing tests
- After each story: conduct review, capture lessons learned, update docs
- Maintain incremental approach - complete one endpoint fully before starting next
- Monitor technical debt and raise concerns early
- Ensure .env files are never committed to repository
