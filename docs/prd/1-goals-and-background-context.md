# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals
- Enable zero-code migration from Ollama to OpenAI-compatible services
- Provide transparent proxy functionality maintaining full Ollama SDK compatibility
- Support core Ollama API endpoints used in production environments
- Minimize latency overhead while maintaining streaming capabilities
- Create a permanent solution for teams using Ollama SDK in production

## 1.2 Background Context
Organizations have invested significantly in applications built with Ollama SDK. When these organizations need to scale beyond local Ollama servers or access more advanced models available through OpenAI-compatible services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, LiteLLM), they face costly refactoring efforts. This proxy service eliminates that friction by providing a drop-in replacement that translates between Ollama and OpenAI APIs transparently, allowing teams to leverage cloud-scale LLM services without modifying their existing codebase.
