# 6. Epic Details

## Epic 1: Foundation & API Contract Analysis
**Goal**: Establish the technical foundation and completely understand Ollama's API contract. This epic ensures we have accurate models, test fixtures, and development infrastructure before implementing any endpoints. Without this foundation, endpoint development would be based on assumptions rather than facts.

### Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured development environment with all dependencies,  
**So that** I can start development with consistent tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Python 3.12 virtual environment configured with all dependencies
2. FastAPI application skeleton with basic project structure created
3. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore (excluding .env files)
4. Docker and docker-compose files for local development
5. Basic README with setup instructions
6. Development scripts (setup_dev.sh, run_tests.sh, run_local.sh) created
7. Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality (black, flake8, mypy)

### Story 1.2: Ollama API Contract Analysis
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to analyze the Ollama API specification and generate accurate models,  
**So that** our proxy perfectly mimics Ollama's behavior.

**Prerequisites**: Story 1.1 must be complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Postman collection (docs/Ollama REST API.postman_collection.json) analyzed and documented
2: Pydantic models generated for all Ollama request/response formats
3: Models validated against actual Ollama server responses
4: Test fixtures created from Postman examples
5: Edge cases and undocumented behaviors identified and documented
6: Compatibility test suite created to verify model accuracy
7: Architecture document updated with findings

**Note**: This is a BLOCKER story - no endpoint development can begin until complete.

### Story 1.3: OpenAI Integration Foundation
**As a** developer,  
**I want** the OpenAI client integration set up and tested,  
**So that** endpoint implementations can focus on translation logic.

**Prerequisites**: 
- Story 1.2 must be complete
- User has created OpenAI account and obtained API key

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: OpenAI Python SDK integrated and configured
2: Environment variable configuration system implemented
3: Instructions documented for user to create .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY
4: Example .env.example file created with required variables
5: Basic OpenAI client wrapper with error handling created
6: Connection testing with actual OpenAI API (using .env credentials)
7: API rate limit handling strategy implemented
8: Model listing functionality verified
9: Streaming response handling prototype tested

## Epic 2: Core Proxy Endpoints
**Goal**: Implement all four required Ollama endpoints with complete translation logic. Each endpoint is developed incrementally with full testing, allowing lessons learned from each to improve the next implementation.

### Story 2.1: /api/tags Endpoint Implementation
**As an** Ollama SDK application,  
**I want** to list available models through the proxy,  
**So that** I can discover which models are available for use.

**Prerequisites**: Epic 1 must be complete

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: GET /api/tags endpoint implemented returning Ollama-format model list
2: OpenAI models fetched and transformed to Ollama format
3: Dummy metadata (size, digest) populated appropriately
4: Integration tests pass using Ollama SDK
5: Error handling for OpenAI API failures
6: Response format exactly matches Ollama server
7: Unit tests achieve >80% coverage
8: Lessons learned documented

**Post-Story Actions**: Review with team, update architecture if needed

### Story 2.2: /api/generate Endpoint Implementation
**As an** Ollama SDK application,  
**I want** to generate text completions through the proxy,  
**So that** I can use OpenAI models for text generation.

**Prerequisites**: Story 2.1 complete with lessons learned applied

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: POST /api/generate endpoint implemented with parameter translation
2: Ollama parameters mapped to OpenAI equivalents (num_predict â†’ max_tokens, etc.)
3: Warnings logged for unmappable parameters (top_k, tfs_z, etc.)
4: Streaming mode fully functional with proper chunk formatting
5: Non-streaming mode returns complete response
6: Integration tests pass for all Ollama SDK generate features
7: Error responses properly translated including rate limit (429) errors
8: Performance verified < 50ms overhead
9: Unit tests achieve >80% coverage

**Post-Story Actions**: Review with team, update parameter mapping documentation

### Story 2.3: /api/chat Endpoint Implementation
**As an** Ollama SDK application,  
**I want** to have conversations through the proxy,  
**So that** I can use OpenAI models for chat interactions.

**Prerequisites**: Story 2.2 complete with lessons learned applied

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: POST /api/chat endpoint implemented with message format translation
2: Ollama message history converted to OpenAI format
3: System/user/assistant roles properly mapped
4: Streaming responses supported with correct formatting
5: Context length handling documented
6: Integration tests pass for all Ollama SDK chat features
7: Multi-turn conversations verified
8: Unit tests achieve >80% coverage

**Post-Story Actions**: Review streaming implementation, document any quirks

### Story 2.4: /api/embeddings Endpoint Implementation
**As an** Ollama SDK application,  
**I want** to generate embeddings through the proxy,  
**So that** I can use OpenAI models for semantic search.

**Prerequisites**: Story 2.3 complete with lessons learned applied

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: POST /api/embeddings endpoint implemented
2: Batch embedding requests handled correctly
3: Response format matches Ollama expectations
4: Appropriate OpenAI embedding model used
5: Integration tests pass for all Ollama SDK embedding features
6: Error handling for oversized requests
7: Unit tests achieve >80% coverage

**Post-Story Actions**: Review all endpoints for consistency

## Epic 3: Production Readiness
**Goal**: Prepare the service for production deployment with proper documentation, testing, monitoring, and deployment configuration. This ensures operators can confidently deploy and maintain the service.

### Story 3.1: Deployment Configuration
**As an** operations engineer,  
**I want** complete deployment configuration,  
**So that** I can deploy the proxy service on-premises.

6: Volume mounts for logs documented
7: Basic deployment guide written

### Story 3.2: Load Testing and Performance Validation
