# Next Steps

## For All Projects:
1. Review this architecture with Product Owner
2. Set up development environment per Story 1.1
3. Begin Ollama API contract analysis per Story 1.2
4. Implement endpoints incrementally per Epic 2
5. Prepare for production deployment per Epic 3

## Specific Development Prompts:
- **Developer Agent:** "Implement the Ollama-to-OpenAI proxy service following the architecture document. Start with Story 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Setup) and follow the incremental development approach. Pay special attention to Story 1.2 (Ollama API Contract Analysis) as it's a blocker for all endpoint development."
- **DevOps Agent:** "Set up Docker containers and docker-compose configuration for the Ollama proxy service as specified in the architecture. Focus on development environment first, then production optimization."
