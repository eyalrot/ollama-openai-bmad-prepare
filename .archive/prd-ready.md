# Product Requirements Document: Ollama-to-OpenAI Proxy Service

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals
- Enable zero-code migration from Ollama to OpenAI-compatible services
- Provide transparent proxy functionality maintaining full Ollama SDK compatibility
- Support core Ollama API endpoints used in production environments
- Minimize latency overhead while maintaining streaming capabilities
- Create a permanent solution for teams using Ollama SDK in production

### 1.2 Background Context
Organizations have invested significantly in applications built with Ollama SDK. When these organizations need to scale beyond local Ollama servers or access more advanced models available through OpenAI-compatible services (OpenAI, OpenRouter, LiteLLM), they face costly refactoring efforts. This proxy service eliminates that friction by providing a drop-in replacement that translates between Ollama and OpenAI APIs transparently, allowing teams to leverage cloud-scale LLM services without modifying their existing codebase.

- **FR2**: The proxy shall provide the `/api/tags` endpoint returning available OpenAI models in Ollama format
- **FR3**: The proxy shall provide the `/api/generate` endpoint supporting both streaming and non-streaming text generation
- **FR4**: The proxy shall provide the `/api/chat` endpoint for conversational interactions with message history
- **FR5**: The proxy shall provide the `/api/embeddings` endpoint for text embedding generation
- **FR6**: The proxy shall translate Ollama request parameters to OpenAI equivalents where possible
- **FR7**: The proxy shall log warnings for Ollama-specific parameters that have no OpenAI equivalent
- **FR8**: The proxy shall translate OpenAI responses back to Ollama-expected formats
- **FR9**: The proxy shall support configuration via environment variables
- **FR10**: The proxy shall map error responses appropriately between formats

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Proxy overhead latency shall be less than 50ms (excluding LLM response time)
- **NFR2**: The system shall support minimum 100 concurrent requests
- **NFR3**: Streaming responses shall maintain real-time performance with minimal buffering
- **NFR4**: The system shall target 99.9% uptime availability

- **NFR6**: The system shall support Python 3.8+ client applications
- **NFR7**: The system shall be deployable via Docker containers
- **NFR8**: All integration tests must pass using Ollama Python SDK as client

## 3. User Interface Design Goals
**Not Applicable** - This is a backend API proxy service with no user interface component in Phase 1. All interactions occur through API endpoints compatible with Ollama SDK.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1 Repository Structure: **Monorepo**
All code, tests, documentation, and deployment configurations will exist in a single repository to simplify development and deployment.

### 4.2 Service Architecture: **Monolith**
Phase 1 implements a single service handling all proxy functionality. This follows KISS principle and avoids unnecessary complexity.

### 4.3 Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Required for all components (translators, handlers, utilities)
- **Integration Testing**: Required using Ollama SDK as client
- **End-to-End Testing**: Required with real OpenAI API (credentials via .env file)
- **Load Testing**: Basic load testing in Epic 3 to validate concurrent request handling
- **Performance Testing**: Not required in Phase 1 (LLM response time >> proxy overhead)

### 4.4 Additional Technical Assumptions
- **Language**: Python 3.12 (exact version required)
- **Framework**: FastAPI for REST API implementation
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with docker-compose for on-premises deployment
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via .env file (not committed to git)
- **Development Environment**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- **Package Management**: venv (virtual environment)
- **OpenAI SDK**: Latest version for backend communication
- **Monitoring**: Basic health check endpoint only (no external service health checks)
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with configurable levels

## 5. Epic List

### Epic 1: Foundation & API Contract Analysis
Establish project infrastructure, development environment, and complete Ollama API contract analysis to generate accurate Pydantic models and test fixtures.

### Epic 2: Core Proxy Endpoints
Implement all four Ollama endpoints with full translation logic, error handling, and streaming support, including comprehensive testing for each.

### Epic 3: Production Readiness
Finalize deployment configuration, documentation, basic monitoring, and load testing to ensure the service is ready for production use.

## 6. Epic Details

### Epic 1: Foundation & API Contract Analysis
**Goal**: Establish the technical foundation and completely understand Ollama's API contract. This epic ensures we have accurate models, test fixtures, and development infrastructure before implementing any endpoints. Without this foundation, endpoint development would be based on assumptions rather than facts.

#### Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured development environment with all dependencies,  
**So that** I can start development with consistent tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Python 3.12 virtual environment configured with all dependencies
2. FastAPI application skeleton with basic project structure created
3. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore (excluding .env files)
4. Docker and docker-compose files for local development
5. Basic README with setup instructions
6. Development scripts (setup_dev.sh, run_tests.sh, run_local.sh) created
7. Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality (black, flake8, mypy)

#### Story 1.2: Ollama API Contract Analysis
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to analyze the Ollama API specification and generate accurate models,  
**So that** our proxy perfectly mimics Ollama's behavior.

## 7. Checklist Results Report
*To be completed after PRD review and validation*

## 8. Next Steps

### 8.1 UX Expert Prompt
**Not Applicable** - This is a backend service with no UI components.

### 8.2 Architect Prompt
"Review the Ollama-to-OpenAI Proxy Service PRD and create a detailed architecture document. Focus on the translation layer design, streaming implementation, and error handling strategies. Ensure the architecture follows KISS/YAGNI principles and supports the incremental development approach outlined in the epics. Pay special attention to the Ollama API contract analysis requirements (Story 1.2) as this is the foundation for all subsequent work."

### 8.3 Scrum Master Guidance
- Each story should be broken into subtasks during sprint planning
- Enforce "Definition of Done" - no story complete without passing tests
- After each story: conduct review, capture lessons learned, update docs
- Maintain incremental approach - complete one endpoint fully before starting next
- Monitor technical debt and raise concerns early
- Ensure .env files are never committed to repository
